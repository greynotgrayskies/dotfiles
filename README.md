# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

I do some janky stuff (for my own entertainment) so use at your own risk.

## Setup

To install all required packages and set up all personal configurations, run:
```
$ make all
```

Alternatively, to just add dotfiles without installing required packages, run:
```
$ make all-dotfiles
```
